    <description>Several security related problems have been discovered in the OpenOffice.org package that allows malformed documents to trick the system into crashes or even the execution of arbitrary code. CVE-2010-3450 During an internal security audit within Red Hat, a directory traversal vulnerability has been discovered in the way OpenOffice.org 3.1.1 through 3.2.1 processes XML filter files. If a local user is tricked into opening a specially-crafted OOo XML filters package file, this problem could allow remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files belonging to local user or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. CVE-2010-3451 During his work as a consultant at Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in OpenOffice.org's RTF parsing functionality. Opening a maliciously crafted RTF document can caus an out-of-bounds memory read into previously allocated heap memory, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. CVE-2010-3452 Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in the RTF file parser which can be leveraged by attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution by convincing a victim to open a maliciously crafted RTF file. CVE-2010-3453 As part of his work with Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in the WW8ListManager::WW8ListManager function of OpenOffice.org that allows a maliciously crafted file to cause the execution of arbitrary code. CVE-2010-3454 As part of his work with Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in the WW8DopTypography::ReadFromMem function in OpenOffice.org that may be exploited by a maliciously crafted file which allowins an attacker to control program flow and potentially execute arbitrary code. CVE-2010-3689 Dmitri Gribenko discovered that the soffice script does not treat an empty LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable like an unset one, may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. CVE-2010-4253 A heap based buffer overflow has been discovered with unknown impact. CVE-2010-4643 A vulnerability has been discovered in the way OpenOffice.org handles TGA graphics which can be tricked by a specially crafted TGA file that could cause the program to crash due to a heap-based buffer overflow with unknown impact.</description>
