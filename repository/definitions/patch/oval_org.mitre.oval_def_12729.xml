    <oval-def:description>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in TYPO3. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems: CVE-2010-3714 Multiple remote file disclosure vulnerabilities in the jumpUrl mechanism and the Extension Manager allowed attackers to read files with the privileges of the account under which the web server was running. CVE-2010-3715 The TYPO3 backend contained several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and the RemoveXSS function did not filter all Javascript code. CVE-2010-3716 Malicious editors with user creation permission could escalate their privileges by creating new users in arbitrary groups, due to lack of input validation in the taskcenter. CVE-2010-3717 TYPO3 exposed a crasher bug in the PHP filter_var function, enabling attackers to cause the web server process to crash and thus consume additional system resources. For the stable distribution , these problems have been fixed in version 4.2.5-1+lenny6. For the unstable distribution  and the upcoming stable distribution , these problems have been fixed in version 4.3.7-1. We recommend that you upgrade your TYPO3 packages.</oval-def:description>
