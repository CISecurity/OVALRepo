    <description>The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.


* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled GS segment register
base switching when recovering from a #SS (stack segment) fault on an
erroneous return to user space. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-9322, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel&amp;#39;s SCTP implementation
handled malformed or duplicate Address Configuration Change Chunks
(ASCONF). A remote attacker could use either of these flaws to crash the
system. (CVE-2014-3673, CVE-2014-3687, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel&amp;#39;s SCTP implementation
handled the association&amp;#39;s output queue. A remote attacker could send
specially crafted packets that would cause the system to use an excessive
amount of memory, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3688,
Important)

* A stack overflow flaw caused by infinite recursion was found in the way
the Linux kernel&amp;#39;s UDF file system implementation processed indirect ICBs.
An attacker with physical access to the system could use a specially
crafted UDF image to crash the system. (CVE-2014-6410, Low)

* It was found that the Linux kernel&amp;#39;s networking implementation did not
correctly handle the setting of the keepalive socket option on raw sockets.
A local user able to create a raw socket could use this flaw to crash the
system. (CVE-2012-6657, Low)

* It was found that the parse_rock_ridge_inode_internal() function of the
Linux kernel&amp;#39;s ISOFS implementation did not correctly check relocated
directories when processing Rock Ridge child link (CL) tags. An attacker
with physical access to the system could use a specially crafted ISO image
to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2014-5471, CVE-2014-5472, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Andy Lutomirski for reporting CVE-2014-9322.
The CVE-2014-3673 issue was discovered by Liu Wei of Red Hat.

Bug fixes:

* This update fixes a race condition issue between the sock_queue_err_skb
function and sk_forward_alloc handling in the socket error queue
(MSG_ERRQUEUE), which could occasionally cause the kernel, for example when
using PTP, to incorrectly track allocated memory for the error queue, in
which case a traceback would occur in the system log. (BZ#1155427)

* The zcrypt device driver did not detect certain crypto cards and the
related domains for crypto adapters on System z and s390x architectures.
Consequently, it was not possible to run the system on new crypto hardware.
This update enables toleration mode for such devices so that the system
can make use of newer crypto hardware. (BZ#1158311)

* After mounting and unmounting an XFS file system several times
consecutively, the umount command occasionally became unresponsive.
This was caused by the xlog_cil_force_lsn() function that was not waiting
for completion as expected. With this update, xlog_cil_force_lsn() has been
modified to correctly wait for completion, thus fixing this bug.
(BZ#1158325)

* When using the ixgbe adapter with disabled LRO and the tx-usec or rs-usec
variables set to 0, transmit interrupts could not be set lower than the
default of 8 buffered tx frames. Consequently, a delay of TCP transfer
occurred. The restriction of a minimum of 8 buffered frames has been
removed, and the TCP delay no longer occurs. (BZ#1158326)

* The offb driver has been updated for the QEMU standard VGA adapter,
fixing an incorrect displaying of colors issue. (BZ#1158328)

* Under certain circumstances, when a discovered MTU expired, the IPv6
connection became unavailable for a short period of time. This bug has been
fixed, and the connection now works as expected. (BZ#1161418)

* A low throughput occurred when using the dm-thin driver to write to
unprovisioned or shared chunks for a thin pool with the chunk size bigger
than the max_sectors_kb variable. (BZ#1161420)

* Large write workloads on thin LVs could cause the iozone and smallfile
utilities to terminate unexpectedly. (BZ#1161421)</description>
