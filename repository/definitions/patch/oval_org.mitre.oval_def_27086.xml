    <description>The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation handled
simultaneous connections between the same hosts. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2014-5077, Important)

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Frame
Buffer device implementation mapped kernel memory to user space via the
mmap syscall. A local user able to access a frame buffer device file
(/dev/fb*) could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the
system. (CVE-2013-2596, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the ipc_rcu_putref() function in the Linux
kernel's IPC implementation handled reference counter decrementing.
A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger an Out of Memory
(OOM) condition and, potentially, crash the system. (CVE-2013-4483,
Moderate)

* It was found that the permission checks performed by the Linux kernel
when a netlink message was received were not sufficient. A local,
unprivileged user could potentially bypass these restrictions by passing a
netlink socket as stdout or stderr to a more privileged process and
altering the output of this process. (CVE-2014-0181, Moderate)

* It was found that the try_to_unmap_cluster() function in the Linux
kernel's Memory Managment subsystem did not properly handle page locking in
certain cases, which could potentially trigger the BUG_ON() macro in the
mlock_vma_page() function. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
to crash the system. (CVE-2014-3122, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's kvm_iommu_map_pages()
function handled IOMMU mapping failures. A privileged user in a guest with
an assigned host device could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2014-3601, Moderate)

* Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way the Linux kernel's
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) implementation handled user
controls. A local, privileged user could use either of these flaws to crash
the system. (CVE-2014-4653, CVE-2014-4654, CVE-2014-4655, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's VFS subsystem handled
reference counting when performing unmount operations on symbolic links.
A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to exhaust all available
memory on the system or, potentially, trigger a use-after-free error,
resulting in a system crash or privilege escalation. (CVE-2014-5045,
Moderate)

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the lzo1x_decompress_safe()
function of the Linux kernel's LZO implementation processed Literal Runs.
A local attacker could, in extremely rare cases, use this flaw to crash the
system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2014-4608, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Vladimir Davydov of Parallels for reporting
CVE-2013-4483, Jack Morgenstein of Mellanox for reporting CVE-2014-3601,
Vasily Averin of Parallels for reporting CVE-2014-5045, and Don A.
Bailey from Lab Mouse Security for reporting CVE-2014-4608. The security
impact of the CVE-2014-3601 issue was discovered by Michael Tsirkin of
Red Hat.

This update also fixes several hundred bugs and adds numerous enhancements.
Refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Release Notes for information on
the most significant of these changes, and the Technical Notes for further
information, both linked to in the References.

All Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 users are advised to install these updated
packages, which correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 Release Notes and
Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to
take effect.</description>
