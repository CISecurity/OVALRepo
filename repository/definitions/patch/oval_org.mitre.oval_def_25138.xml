    <description>The mod_wsgi adapter is an Apache module that provides a WSGI-compliant
interface for hosting Python-based web applications within Apache.

It was found that mod_wsgi did not properly drop privileges if the call to
setuid() failed. If mod_wsgi was set up to allow unprivileged users to run
WSGI applications, a local user able to run a WSGI application could
possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.
(CVE-2014-0240)

Note: mod_wsgi is not intended to provide privilege separation for WSGI
applications. Systems relying on mod_wsgi to limit or sandbox the
privileges of mod_wsgi applications should migrate to a different solution
with proper privilege separation.

It was discovered that mod_wsgi could leak memory of a hosted web
application via the "Content-Type" header. A remote attacker could possibly
use this flaw to disclose limited portions of the web application's memory.
(CVE-2014-0242)

Red Hat would like to thank Graham Dumpleton for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges RÃ³bert Kisteleki as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-0240, and Buck Golemon as the original reporter of CVE-2014-0242.

All mod_wsgi users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.</description>
