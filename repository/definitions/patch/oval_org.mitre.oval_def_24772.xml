    <oval-def:description>OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a
specially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for
communication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt
and modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)

Note: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be
using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL
version 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of
OpenSSL. For more information about this flaw, refer to:
https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter
of this issue.

All OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take
effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other
SSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.</oval-def:description>
