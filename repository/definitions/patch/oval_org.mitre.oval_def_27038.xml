    <description><![CDATA[Multiple use-after-free issues were discovered in Blink. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash,
or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render
process. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3178">CVE-2014-3178</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3190">CVE-2014-3190</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3191">CVE-2014-3191</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3192">CVE-2014-3192</a>)

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were
tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of
service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3179">CVE-2014-3179</a>,
<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3200">CVE-2014-3200</a>)

It was discovered that Chromium did not properly handle the interaction of
IPC and V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted
website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3188">CVE-2014-3188</a>)

A use-after-free was discovered in the web workers implementation in
Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,
an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service
via applicatin crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3194">CVE-2014-3194</a>)

It was discovered that V8 did not correctly handle Javascript heap
allocations in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
steal sensitive information. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3195">CVE-2014-3195</a>)

It was discovered that Blink did not properly provide substitute data for
pages blocked by the XSS auditor. If a user were tricked in to opening a
specially crafter website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to
steal sensitive information. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3197">CVE-2014-3197</a>)

It was discovered that the wrap function for Event&#39;s in the V8 bindings
in Blink produced an erroneous result in some circumstances. If a user
were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service by stopping a worker
process that was handling an Event object. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3199">CVE-2014-3199</a>)

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in
to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially
exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via
renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
sandboxed render process. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7967">CVE-2014-7967</a>)]]></description>
