    <description><![CDATA[virt-v2v is a tool for converting and importing virtual machines to
libvirt-managed KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), or Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization.

Using virt-v2v to convert a guest that has a password-protected VNC console
to a KVM guest removed that password protection from the converted guest:
after conversion, a password was not required to access the converted
guest&#39;s VNC console. Now, converted guests will require the same VNC
console password as the original guest. Note that when converting a guest
to run on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, virt-v2v will display a
warning that VNC passwords are not supported. (CVE-2011-1773)

Note: The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 perl-Sys-Virt update must also be
installed to correct CVE-2011-1773.

Bug fixes:

* When converting a guest virtual machine (VM), whose name contained
certain characters, virt-v2v would create a converted guest with a
corrupted name. Now, virt-v2v will not corrupt guest names. (BZ#665883)

* There were numerous usability issues when running virt-v2v as a non-root
user. This update makes it simpler to run virt-v2v as a non-root user.
(BZ#671094)

* virt-v2v failed to convert a Microsoft Windows guest with Windows
Recovery Console installed in a separate partition. Now, virt-v2v will
successfully convert a guest with Windows Recovery Console installed in a
separate partition by ignoring that partition. (BZ#673066)

* virt-v2v failed to convert a Red Hat Enterprise Linux guest which did not
have the symlink &quot;/boot/grub/menu.lst&quot;. With this update, virt-v2v can
select a grub configuration file from several places. (BZ#694364)

* This update removes information about the usage of deprecated command
line options in the virt-v2v man page. (BZ#694370)

* virt-v2v would fail to correctly change the allocation policy, (sparse or
preallocated) when converting a guest with QCOW2 image format. The error
message &quot;Cannot import VM, The selected disk configuration is not
supported&quot; was displayed. With this update, allocation policy changes to a
guest with QCOW2 storage will work correctly. (BZ#696089)

* The options &quot;--network&quot; and &quot;--bridge&quot; can not be used in conjunction
when converting a guest, but no error message was displayed. With this
update, virt-v2v will now display an error message if the mutually
exclusive &quot;--network&quot; and &quot;--bridge&quot; command line options are both
specified. (BZ#700759)

* virt-v2v failed to convert a multi-boot guest, and did not clean up
temporary storage and mount points after failure. With this update,
virt-v2v will prompt for which operating system to convert from a
multi-boot guest, and will correctly clean up if the process fails.
(BZ#702007)

* virt-v2v failed to correctly configure modprobe aliases when converting a
VMware ESX guest with VMware Tools installed. With this update, modprobe
aliases will be correctly configured. (BZ#707261)

* When converting a guest with preallocated raw storage using the
libvirtxml input method, virt-v2v failed with the erroneous error message
&quot;size(X) &lt; usage(Y)&quot;. This update removes this erroneous error. (BZ#727489)

* When converting a Red Hat Enterprise Linux guest, virt-v2v did not check
that the Cirrus X driver was available before configuring it. With this
update, virt-v2v will attempt to install the Cirrus X driver if it is
required. (BZ#708961)

* VirtIO systems do not support the Windows Recovery Console on 32-bit
Windows XP. The virt-v2v man page has been updated to note this. On Windows
XP Professional x64 Edition, however, if Windows Recovery Console is
re-installed after conversion, it will work as expected. (BZ#732421)

* Placing comments in the guest fstab file by means of the leading &quot;#&quot;
symbol caused an &quot;unknown filesystem&quot; error after conversion of a guest.
With this update comments can now be used and error messages will not be
displayed. (BZ#677870)

Users of virt-v2v should upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these
issues and upgrades virt-v2v to version 0.8.3.]]></description>
