    <description>A device running Cisco IOSÂ® Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or Cisco IOS XR Software is vulnerable to a remote denial of service (DoS) condition if it is configured for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and has support for Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).  A crafted LDP UDP packet can cause an affected device running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software to reload. On devices running affected versions of Cisco IOS XR Software, such packets can cause the device to restart the mpls_ldp process.  A system is vulnerable if configured with either LDP or Tag Distribution Protocol (TDP).  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.  Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-ldp["%5B%5BPublication_URL%5D%5D"].  Note: The March 24, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Security Advisories. All the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table at this URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities that have been published on March 24, 2010, or earlier:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-bundle["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-bundle"]  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at this link:  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar10.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar10.html"]</description>
