    <oval-def:description>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows Defender Security Center handles certain objects in memory. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted command that could exploit the vulnerability to elevate privileges. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Defender Security Center handles certain objects in memory.</oval-def:description>
