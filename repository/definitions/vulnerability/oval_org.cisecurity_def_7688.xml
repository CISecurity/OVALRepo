    <description>A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands with administrative privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web UI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with administrative privileges on an affected device. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
