    <description>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Storage Services improperly handle file operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need code execution on a victim system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application. The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring the Windows Storage Services properly handle file operations.</description>
