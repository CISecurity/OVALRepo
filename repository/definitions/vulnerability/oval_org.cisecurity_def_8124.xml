    <description>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Connected User Experiences and Telemetry Service improperly handles file operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run processes in an elevated context. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application on the victim system. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Connected User Experiences and Telemetry Service handles file operations.</description>
