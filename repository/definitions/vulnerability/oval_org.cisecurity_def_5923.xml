    <description>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Search handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker could send specially crafted messages to the Windows Search service. An attacker with access to a target computer could exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges and take control of the computer. Additionally, in an enterprise scenario, a remote authenticated attacker could remotely trigger the vulnerability through an SMB connection and then take control of a target computer. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Search handles objects in memory.</description>
