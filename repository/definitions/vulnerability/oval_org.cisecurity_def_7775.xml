    <description>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows Error Reporting manager improperly handles a process crash. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could delete a targeted file leading to an elevated status. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Error Reporting manager handles process crashes.</description>
