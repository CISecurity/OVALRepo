    <description>Cisco IOSÂ® Software contains a vulnerability when the Cisco IOS SSL VPN feature is configured with an HTTP redirect. Exploitation could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to cause a memory leak on the affected devices, that could result in a memory exhaustion condition that may cause device reloads, the inability to service new TCP connections, and other denial of service (DoS) conditions.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround to mitigate this vulnerability.  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-sslvpn["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-sslvpn"].  Note: The September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. Five of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table at the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities that have been published on September 22, 2010, or earlier:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle"]  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html"]</description>
