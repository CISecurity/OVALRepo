    <oval-def:description>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft Windows fails to handle file creation permissions, which could allow an attacker to create files in a protected Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) location. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could run a specially crafted application to bypass Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) variable security in Windows. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting security feature behavior to enforce permissions.</oval-def:description>
