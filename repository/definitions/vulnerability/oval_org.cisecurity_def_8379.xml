    <oval-def:description>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel improperly initializes objects in memory. To exploit this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker could run a specially crafted application. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the userâ€™s system. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel initializes objects in memory.</oval-def:description>
