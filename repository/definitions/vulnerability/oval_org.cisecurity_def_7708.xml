    <description>A vulnerability in Role Based Access Control (RBAC) functionality of Cisco IOS XE Web Management Software could allow a Read-Only authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands or configuration changes as an Admin user. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of RBAC for the administration GUI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a modified HTTP request to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker as a Read-Only user to execute CLI commands or configuration changes as if they were an Admin user. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
