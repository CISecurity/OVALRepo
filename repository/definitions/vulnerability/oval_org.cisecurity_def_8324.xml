    <description>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in how splwow64.exe handles certain calls. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the userâ€™s system (low-integrity to medium-integrity). This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution; however, it could allow arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses it in combination with another vulnerability (such as a remote code execution vulnerability or another elevation of privilege vulnerability) that is capable of leveraging the elevated privileges when code execution is attempted. The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring splwow64.exe properly handles these calls.</description>
