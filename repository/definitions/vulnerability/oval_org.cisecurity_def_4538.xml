    <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS Software forwarding queue of Cisco 2960X and 3750X switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak in the software forwarding queue that would eventually lead to a partial denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to improper processing of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of IPv6 ND packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak in the software forwarding queue that would eventually lead to a partial DoS service condition.</description>
