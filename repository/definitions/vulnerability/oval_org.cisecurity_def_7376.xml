    <oval-def:description>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Windows Error Reporting improperly handles file operations. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to gain execution on the victim system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application to disclose information. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Error Reporting handles file operations.</oval-def:description>
