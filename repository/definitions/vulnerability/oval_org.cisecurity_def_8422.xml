    <description>A denial of service vulnerability exists when Connected User Experiences and Telemetry Service improperly handles file operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a system to stop responding. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Connected User Experiences and Telemetry Service handles file operations.</description>
