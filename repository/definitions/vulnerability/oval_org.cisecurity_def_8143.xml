    <description>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Work Folders Service improperly handles memory. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to gain execution on the victim system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application to elevate privileges. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Work Folders Service handles memory.</description>
