    <description>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) server handles certain requests. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the ability to execute code on the target server. To exploit the vulnerability, in most situations, an authenticated attacker could send a specially crafted packet to a targeted SMBv1 server. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how SMBv1 handles these specially crafted requests.</description>
