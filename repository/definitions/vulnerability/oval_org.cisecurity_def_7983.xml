    <description>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows Mobile Device Management (MDM) Diagnostics improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass access restrictions to delete files. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and remove files. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the how Windows MDM Diagnostics handles objects in memory.</description>
