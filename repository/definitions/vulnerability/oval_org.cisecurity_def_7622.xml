    <description>A denial of service vulnerability exists when Hyper-V on a Windows Server fails to properly handle specially crafted network packets. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would send specially crafted network packets to the Hyper-V Server. The security update addresses the vulnerability by resolving the conditions where Hyper-V would fail to properly handle these network packets.</description>
