    <description>A vulnerability in the Virtual Services Container of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain root-level privileges on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of a user-supplied open virtual appliance (OVA). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a malicious OVA on an affected device. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
