    <description>A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to improper input sanitization. An attacker who has valid administrative access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted input parameter on a form in the web UI and then submitting that form. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device, which could lead to complete system compromise.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-web-cmdinj4-S2TmH7GA ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-web-cmdinj4-S2TmH7GA"]  This advisory is part of the June 3, 2020, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 23 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 25 vulnerabilities.
