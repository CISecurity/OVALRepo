						            Photoshop version 23.5.3 (and earlier), 24.1 (and earlier) are affected by an Improper
						            Input Validation vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the
						            context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in
						            that a victim must open a malicious file. (CVE-2023-21574)
						            Photoshop version 23.5.3 (and earlier), 24.1 (and earlier) are affected by an
						            out-of-bounds write vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the
						            context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in
						            that a victim must open a malicious file. (CVE-2023-21575)
