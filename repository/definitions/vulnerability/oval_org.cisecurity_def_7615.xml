    <description>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Color Management Module (ICM32.dll) handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Color Management Module handles objects in memory.</description>
