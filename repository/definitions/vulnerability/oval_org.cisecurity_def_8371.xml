    <oval-def:description>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Graphics Components handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on a target system. To exploit the vulnerability, a user would have to open a specially crafted file. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Graphics Components handle objects in memory.</oval-def:description>
