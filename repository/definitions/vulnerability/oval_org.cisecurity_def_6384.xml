    <description>A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Windows DHCP client when an attacker sends specially crafted DHCP responses to a client. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code on the client machine. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send specially crafted DHCP responses to a client. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows DHCP clients handle certain DHCP responses.</description>
