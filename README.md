# OVAL Repository
Welcome to the Center for Internet Security's OVAL Repository!  In cooperation with the OVAL Community, 
we have established this repository to carry on the function and purpose of the original OVAL Repository 
(run by MITRE through July 31, 2015).  

We hope this new repository reflects new and exciting progress within the OVAL Community to 
revitialize and refresh the quantity and quality of the content we produce and rely upon.

Consumers and contributors are invited to engage using this repository.
