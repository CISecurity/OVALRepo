# Contributing OVAL

This document includes processes and guidelines for contributing OVAL to the repository.

There are three options for contributing content to the repository:

- [Ad Hoc Contribution](#ad-hoc-contribution)
- [Ongoing Contribution by Email](#ongoing-contribution-by-email) (temporary)
- [Ongoing Contribution via Git](#ongoing-contribution-by-git) (recommended)

## Status: Work in Progress
*Please note: this documentation is a work in progress. If you have questions or suggestions, 
please [create an issue](https://github.com/CISecurity/OVALRepo/issues/new) with a full
description of your question or idea.*

## Getting Help, Making Suggestions

If you need help understanding and following this process, please post your
questions to the [OVAL Repository Mailing List](https://lists.cisecurity.org/list/oval_repository.lists.cisecurity.org).

If you encounter issues or have ideas for improving this process, please 
[create an issue](https://github.com/CISecurity/OVALRepo/issues/new) with a full
description of your issue or idea.

## Ad Hoc Contribution

If you have a suggestion for adding or updating content, but are not interested in being a regular
contributor or [making your contribution via git](#ongoing-contribution-by-git), please post your
content suggetions to the [OVAL Repository Mailing List](https://lists.cisecurity.org/list/oval_repository.lists.cisecurity.org) and ask for a regular contributor
to incorporate them into a formal contribution.

## Ongoing Contribution by Email

In order to ease the transition for content contributors, the repository will accept contributions
of valid OVAL sent by email to the [OVAL Repository Mailing List](https://lists.cisecurity.org/list/oval_repository.lists.cisecurity.org).

This option will be available for a limited time and we recommend that you plan to adopt the 
[contribution via git](#ongoing-contribution-by-git) option.

## Ongoing Contribution via Git

The process for contributing via Git has been designed to follow a mature practice for collaborative 
development using git called the "fork & pull" model [learn more](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### High-Level Overview

#### Before you begin (one-time setup)

- You have a [GitHub account](https://github.com)
- You have [set up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) on your machine
- You have [created a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of this [OVAL repository](https://github.com/CISecurity/OVALRepo) 
- You have [created a local clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork) of your fork

#### Making a Contribution

- **Create a Topic Branch**: create a branch in which you will create your submission. You should create a topic branch for each set of changes that you think should be reviewed and accepted as unit.

- **Make Updates**: add, update and delete elements in your topic branch.

- **Commit Updates**: commit your updates.

- **Quality Assurance**: make sure that definitions affected by your contribution schema and schematron validate
using our provided scripts or your own validation scripts. (additional QA guidelines TBD). If you have any validation
issues, resolve them before proceeding.

- **Push Commits to Your Fork**: publish you submission to your own fork.

- **Initiate a Pull Request ("PR")**: 
  1. Go to your fork on GitHub.com
  2. Switch to your feature branch\
  3. Click the green "Compare and Review" button 
  4. Review the changes to insure they're correct and click "Create Pull Request"
  5. Add a descriptive title and a description of the submission and click "Create Pull Request"

- **Community Review**: GitHub will notify CIS and the community that you have made a PR.
Community members may add questions and comments to the PR discussion page, to which you are 
encouraged to respond. CIS will perform QA on your PR, and will add any issues or concerns they've uncovered to the PR discussion page.

- **Issue Resolution**: If there are issues you wish to resolve, you may update update your PR by following
steps 2-5 above.

- **QA**: Once any issues have been resolved, and the PR is ready for processing, CIS will perform a number of quality assurance checks on the submission to determine acceptability:

	- Determining if any changes are deleted items: If the PR contains element deletions, i.e. removing a definition, the user is asked to accept these changes.
	- Removing items that don't contain meaningful changes: If any elements in the submission are unchanged, they are pruned from the submission process.
	- Checking correctness of definition metadata:
		- If any NEW definitions are being submitted, the following restrictions apply:
			- The new definition MUST have a `version` attribute value of "0"
			- The new definition MUST have a `<status>` of "INITIAL SUBMISSION"
			- Within the `<oval_repository>/<dates>` element, the new definition MUST include a `<submitted>` element indicating the date of submission, as well as the `<contributor>` sub-element indicating the organization and user submitting the definition.
			- The new definition MUST NOT include any `<status_change>` elements
		- When the PR contains UPDATED definitions:
			- The updated definition MUST include a `<modified>` element describing the update, as well as the `<contributor>` sub-element indicating the organization and user submitting the definition.
			- A `<status_change>` element MUST be included, reverting the definition's status, if necessary:
				- If the current definition status is "DRAFT", the `<status_change>` element value is DRAFT
				- If the current definition status is "INTERIM", the `<status_change>` element value is INTERIM
				- If the current definition status is "ACCEPTED", the `<status_change>` element value is INTERIM
			- The `<status>` element MUST be updated to match the most recent `<status_change>` value.
	- The separated PR files are assembled into a single OVAL definitions file and schema validated.
	- Individual definitions are assembled and the minimum schema version is determined.  The minimum schema version is the lowest OVAL version for which the definition (and its components) remain schema-valid.
	- If any NEW elements (tests, objects, states, variables) are included in the submission, they are processed:
		- Any NEW element MUST have a `version` attribute value of "0"
		- Any NEW element will have its OVAL `id` value regenerated as the next available `oval:org.cisecurity`-based value, and its `version` attribute then incremented to "1".
		- Any NEW elements will then be organized into the appropriate repository folder structure per its new `id` and element type.

	New Definition Example:
```
<definition xmlns="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5" class="vulnerability" id="oval:org.zackport:def:100" version="0">
...
  <oval_repository>
    <dates>
      <submitted date="2018-10-16T11:00:00.000-04:00">
        <contributor organization="CIS">Zackary Port</contributor>
      </submitted>
    </dates>

    <status>INITIAL SUBMISSION</status>
  </oval_repository>
...
</definition>
```



- **Submission Acceptable**: Once CIS has completed QA, they will accept the PR, merging your changes into 
the master branch of this repository.

- **Clean Up**: once your PR has been accepted, you should delete your topic branch and update your master
branch from the upstream/master so you have all the latest content (including your submission)!

##### Sample Git Commands

```
Shell
# switch to your master branch, if you're not on it already
$ git checkout master

# add the master repository as the upstream remote, if you haven't
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/CISecurity/OVALRepo.git

# merge changes from upstream into your master
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master

# create a topic branch and switch to it
$ git checkout -b [topic branch name]

# make changes to OVAL content files

# check to see the changes you've made
$ git status

# if you've created any new files, add them
$ git add [new files]

# if you've deleted files, delete them in git
$ git add -u

# commit updates
$ git commit -am '[a descriptive note about this commit]'

# QA your submission

# push branch and commits to your fork
$ git push origin [topic branch name]

# initiate your PR

# after acceptance, delete topic branch (don't merge!)
git checkout master
git branch -D [topic branch name]
git push origin :[topic branch name]

# and finally, get updates from master
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
```
